#Zhaorui's work

##Project Goal
1. OpenCV implementation of markerless AR
	- Rough. PC-end. Realtime.
	- With a simple openGL rendered object.
2. An Unity-based SDK-based application of AR
	- Possibly markerless
	- Animation of the characters 
	- Interaction techniques, voice control, target follow.  

##Project Timeline
1. Finish the literature review by the end of the reading week.  
2. OpenCV C++ implementation of markerless AR, following *Mastering OpenCV*
3. Prepare for the presentation.
4. (Optional) Transplant to openCV python.
5. (Optional) Animate character.
5. Work on the SDK-version of the application, by the end of March.
6. Debug and finish the project report, starting in April.

##This week finished:
- Feature extracting and matchting
- Camera Calibration
- Pose estimation

##Currently work on:
- Solve PnP
- Projection

##Problems
1. What does homography estimation do? Why it is always 4?
