#Project Goal
1. OpenCV implementation of markerless AR
	- Very Rough. PC-end. Realtime.
	- With a simple openGL rendered object/character.
	- Possibly simple animation.
2. An Unity-based SDK-based application of AR
	- Possibly markerless
	- Animation of the characters 
	- Interaction techniques, voice control, target follow.  

#Project Timeline
1. Finish the literature review by the end of the reading week.  
2. OpenCV C++ implementation of markerless AR, following *Mastering OpenCV*, by early March.
3. Prepare for the presentation.
4. (Optional) Transplant to openCV python.
5. (Optional) Animate character.
5. Work on the SDK-version of the application, by the end of March.
6. Debug and finish the project report, starting in April.
