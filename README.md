# Zhaorui's work for course project
(Not yet finished)  
An implementation of markerless augmentment reality, based on openCV3.0 bindings for python3.  

Ideas come from the book Mastering OpenCV codework: [code](https://github.com/MasteringOpenCV/code) copyright by Packt Publishing 2012  

## Project Goal
1. OpenCV implementation of markerless AR
	- Rough. PC-end. Realtime.
	- With a simple openGL rendered object.
2. An Unity-based SDK-based application of AR
	- Possibly markerless
	- Animation of the characters 
	- Interaction techniques, voice control, target follow.  

## This week finished:
- Feature extracting and matchting  
- Camera Calibration  
- Pose estimation  

## Currently work on:
- Solve PnP  
- Projection  

## Problems
1. What does homography estimation do? Why it is always 4?
